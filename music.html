                        Music is said to enhance intelligence and focus, improve mental health, and boost the immune system as well as self-esteem and confidence. It can be used to relax, to boost and lift our mood, or to improve concentration. Music can also be used to aid in insomnia, helping to encourage and induce a deeper sleep. Many people have expressed how music is a form of ‘ escape’, and can quickly and effectively transport them to a better time, place, or memory.

Relaxation music helps you connect to your inner peace. When you quiet your thoughts and feel your source of peace within, it's like having a stress-proof field around you. Reducing stress not only makes you feel much better, it can also bring improved health. Music is a powerful tool that can switch off the stress response and in turn improve our emotional health. Whether one listens to, plays or sings doesn’t matter. All of it has proven benefits.</p>

                            </h3>
                        <p class = "text text-sm">Devotional singing, known as bhajans or kirtan, can help to quiet the mind so that the heart can open to the divine, allowing us to taste the blissful reality that is our true nature. It is a participatory spiritual practice in which everyone is encouraged to sing and express their inner joy. Devotion, not musical ability, is the most important aspect of kirtan. To gain concentration in this age of materialism, bhajan is easier than meditation. By loud singing, other distracting sounds will be overcome and concentration will be achieved. Bhajan, concentration and meditation, this is the progression. Bhajan is important for the devotee because it is intimate and free in expression. Bhajan preserves India’s rich legacy of devotion, wisdom and mysticism from saints like Meerabai, Tulsidas, Kabir, Surdas, Thyagaraja, Purandaradasa, Tukaram, Namdev, and many, many others.

                        <h3>Podcasts</h3>
                        <p class = "text text-sm">Many studies have been done on the benefits of podcasts, and what they do for people mentally. One study proves that podcasts stimulate mental imagery more intensely than watching or reading, and cause listeners to have to pay more attention. Since people listen to podcasts instead of watching them, it forces listeners to use their imagination and build the pictures in their mind. Thus, people who listen to podcasts regularly have a stronger and more vivid imagination.

                            Podcasts also help us become better listeners. Since they are all about listening, they helps us have a greater appreciation for simply listening. Podcasts allow us to become a part of what we’re listening, and trigger us to listen, pay attention, and then use our imagination to form pictures of the story of what you’re listening to. Podcasts stimulate different parts of the brain, forcing us to actively listen, especially since it’s a topic we’re truly interested in.</p>
