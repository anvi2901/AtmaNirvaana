                <h1> "Nobody Expects Medical Doctors To Never Catch A Flu. Then Why The Stigma?" May 2022 Saumya Swamy</h1>
                Nobody expects medical doctors to never catch a flu. Then why the stigma?

I'm a 21 year old psychology major. I have been going to therapy - on and off - since I was 14. Growing up, I was fortunate to have a mother who believed in the power of therapeutic healing. She sensed I needed external help because of how easily overwhelmed I got. My mental health journey began then, and ever since, I have changed 4 therapists - for different purposes - and have finally found my perfect one now.



I always knew I had clinical anxiety, worrying and over-preparing was how I would cope. It was my way to stay in control - this can happen when your nervous system is constantly in flight-or-fight. I'm also a severe Type A personality, which to the bare eye seemed "damn, she's really well put-together!", but within, it only further made me feel uncomfortable to take even a slightest bit of a break. When I brought this up in therapy, my psychologist said "you find resting difficult because it interrupts your worrying, and resting is unsafe & unfamiliar for you.". The amount of insight therapy has brought me is truly insane. Being in the field myself, it doesn't get any easier. This one time I exhibited vulnerability towards a colleague, I was asked to "go look at my notes". It's like people don't expect budding psychologists to have their own set of issues - and that's messed up. Nobody expects medical doctors to never catch a flu. Then why the stigma? Today, I have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder diagnosis, coupled with my naturally high- functioning self - a challenging combination. But you know what? I'll manage it - and this is not just the control freak in me talking. I'm committed to bettering myself for me and for people around me. I choose to move forward with grace and love. I'm currently preparing to further my clinical studies in the UK. I want to have my own clinic someday, with efficient psycho-education, mental health care and animal therapy! A few years ago, I would never have imagined myself saying this but - I can't wait to see what the future holds for me, and it

is OKAY if it doesn't pan out exactly the way I planned it. Whatever comes my way, I know I'll make the best of it. One step at a time, child <3
